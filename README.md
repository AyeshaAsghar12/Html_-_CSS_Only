### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Only using Box Model
- CSS general


### What I learned

I learned to build a scall QR code card design which i can use on any website for accessing the profiles.

### Continued development

I found little tricky to center a div using box model. Will learn more new techniques to do that in future.
